# Data-Raw/

`scripts/` Contains all of the code used to clean the original raw data. 

To allow for faster installation of the `evaluationDB` library and keep this repository to a minimum size, the raw-data is stored separately at (https://github.com/williamlief/evaluationDB-Raw)[https://github.com/williamlief/evaluationDB-Raw]. If you wish to check the data cleaning process yourself, please clone the full repository for the [evaluationDB](https://github.com/williamlief/evaluationDB) and use the `evaluationDB::raw_data_import` to download the raw data from github and install it into the project directory.
